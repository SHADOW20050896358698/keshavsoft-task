 Bootstrap 5 UI – Internship Task

This is a small three-page website built for the KeshavSoft Bootstrap 5 internship task. [keshavsoft](https://keshavsoft.com/Interns/task1_new.pdf)
What I built

- `index.html` – Home page with navbar, hero section, features, and footer.  
- `about.html` – Page that explains the idea and possible use cases of this layout.  
- `contact.html` – Page with a Bootstrap contact form and basic contact details.

Steps I followed

1. Set up a simple folder with `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`, and linked Bootstrap 5 via CDN.  
2. Explored the official Bootstrap 5 docs and example pages to understand navbars, grids, cards, and forms. [keshavsoft](https://keshavsoft.com/Interns/task1_new.pdf)
3. Designed the home page using a hero section and feature cards, keeping the navbar and footer common for all pages.  
4. Wrote the about page to briefly describe the structure and purpose of the project.  
5. Created the contact page with a working HTML form using Bootstrap form components and some helper text.  
6. Tested the pages on different screen sizes and adjusted spacing using Bootstrap utility classes to keep it responsive.

 Tools and help

I used the Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples for reference and used an AI assistant (Perplexity, powered by GPT) to help with some of the HTML structure and wording, then reviewed and adjusted everything myself. [keshavsoft](https://keshavsoft.com/Interns/task1_new.pdf)
